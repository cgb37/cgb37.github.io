# Blog Post Hero Image Creator

Create a professional, high-quality hero (jumbo) image for a technical blog post.

## Image Specifications

- **Dimensions**: 1920x1080 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: WebP
- **Style**: Modern, professional, tech-focused

## Design Guidelines

1. **Visual Style** (CRITICAL - Match existing blog aesthetic):
   - **Epic cinematic quality**: Premium digital art with Hollywood-level production value
   - **Rich, vibrant colors**: Deep blues, bright teals/cyans, cosmic purples, warm oranges
   - **Maximum depth**: Multiple layers with atmospheric perspective, fog, light beams
   - **Sci-fi epic feel**: Think interstellar travel, massive tech infrastructure, cosmic scale
   - **Professional artistry**: This should look like AAA game concept art or movie posters
   - **Dramatic lighting**: Strong contrast, lens flares, volumetric lighting, glowing elements
   - **Atmospheric effects**: Particles, energy fields, nebulas, holographic elements

2. **Content**:
   - Create grand visual metaphors for technical concepts
   - Code and tech elements integrated into epic 3D environments
   - Can show: futuristic cityscapes, space stations, massive servers, cosmic code streams
   - Think BIG - spaceships, planets, vast infrastructure, epic scale
   - Hero shots with strong focal points and dramatic perspective

3. **Composition**:
   - Wide, cinematic framing perfect for hero banners
   - Strong focal point with layered depth
   - Rule of thirds for dynamic composition
   - Leave strategic negative space for potential text overlays
   - Create visual flow that draws the eye through the image

4. **Reference Style**:
   - Study existing blog hero images (especially the Symfony spaceship one)
   - Inspiration: Interstellar, Tron, Blade Runner 2049, Mass Effect
   - Each image should tell a story and create an emotional connection
   - Avoid anything flat, minimal, or corporate-looking

## File Naming

Save the hero image as: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug-jumbo.webp` in the `images/posts/svg/` directory

## Task

Based on the blog post topic provided, create a hero/jumbo image that:
1. Creates EPIC visual impact worthy of a movie poster
2. Uses rich, saturated colors (cosmic blues, vibrant teals, dramatic oranges)
3. Has maximum depth with atmospheric effects and layered composition
4. Tells a visual story through grand metaphors and sci-fi imagery
5. Matches the premium, cinematic, almost cosmic aesthetic of the existing blog
6. Makes viewers stop and say "whoa, that's beautiful"

**STYLE MANDATE**: Your hero images must be visually STUNNING. Think big-budget sci-fi films and AAA video games. Every image should have dramatic lighting, atmospheric depth, and epic scale. NO flat designs, NO minimalism, NO corporate stock photo aesthetics. This is premium concept art for developers.

Please provide the blog post topic or title, and I'll generate an appropriate hero image.
