        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Deploying PHP applications across multiple environments, such as staging and production, demands a meticulous approach to manage dependencies. Composer, the go-to dependency manager for PHP, utilizes `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files to manage package versions. But what happens when you need to switch a library? How does that affect your deployment, especially when leveraging Azure Web Apps for Containers? This post dives into the best practices for managing Composer dependencies to ensure consistency and stability across your deployments.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>When managing PHP applications across different environments, developers often face the challenge of ensuring that the exact versions of dependencies are used across the board. This consistency is crucial for preventing the dreaded "works on my machine" syndrome. The question arises: whenever you switch a Composer library, do you need to delete the `composer.lock` file on each version and then run `composer install`? Understanding the role of `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files is essential in navigating these waters.</p>

        <h2>Approach and Thought Process</h2>
        <p>Initially, one might think that updating dependencies or switching libraries requires removing the `composer.lock` file to allow for fresh installation. However, this approach could lead to inconsistencies across environments. Instead, it's crucial to understand the distinction between `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files and the specific role each plays in dependency management.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Correct Code Solution</h2>
        <pre><code># Updating a single package
composer update [package name]
Updating all dependencies
composer update

Installing dependencies in production or staging
composer install
</code></pre>

        <p>Note: These commands assume you have already made the necessary changes to your `composer.json` file.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Solution Explanation</h2>
        <p>Switching a Composer library involves updating `composer.json` and running `composer update`, which regenerates the `composer.lock` file. This file should then be committed to version control to ensure that staging and production environments install the exact versions of dependencies that were tested. `composer install` uses the `composer.lock` file, eliminating the need to delete it and ensuring consistency and stability across deployments. This process guarantees that all environments run the same code, minimizing deployment risks.</p>

        <h2>Testing and Edge Cases</h2>
        <p>It's essential to thoroughly test your application after updating dependencies to catch any potential issues early. Consider setting up a dedicated testing environment or using automated testing pipelines to streamline this process. Pay special attention to major version changes or switching out libraries, as these are common points of failure.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Further Improvements</h2>
        <p>Managing Composer dependencies across multiple environments doesn't have to be a daunting task. By leveraging the `composer.lock` file and adhering to best practices, you can ensure that your PHP applications deploy smoothly, regardless of the environment. Remember, the goal is to achieve consistent, predictable deployments that mirror your development environment as closely as possible. Continuously explore new Composer features and integration tools to further streamline your deployment process.</p>
